Folder Six tests the following:
This test consists of all commands and their responses to a user who enters an invalid command,
invalid placements when placing tiles, invalid placement of a tile which consists of a duplicate.
The test will also display various error messages, when specific situations occur.
This test is not designed to enter any statements which 'throw' an error.
This test cannot test the FIRST initial tile placement as we must load a test file,
however if a user places a tile at Round 1, with no tiles on the board, and tries to place
the tile in a corner they are unable to do such and given another chance to place a tile elsewhere.
